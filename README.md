# Visual Studio Code Beautify JSON Extension

Beautify ugly JSON inside Visual Studio Code, effortlessly.

> F1 > Beautify JSON

A revised, updated and actively maintained fork of [Prettify JSON](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohsen1.prettify-json).

The original extension looks abandoned and uses deprecated APIs, bearing some concern for such a popular extension. TODOs have also been addressed.
